        Landscape Engineering Lifecycle Model (VLE) \n ModelProgramResource The Value
        Landscape Engineering (VLE) spreadsheet program identifies the costs, labor,
        water, fertilizers, pesticides, energy, and fuel required to install and maintain
        a residential or commercial landscape in Utah. The program also identifies
        the carbon footprint and particulates generated from landscape installation
        and maintenance activities.  VLE considers all activities associated with
        a particular landscape over its life with the goal to maximize value and reduce
        required inputs. The VLE spreadsheet program tabulates all onsite costs, inputs,
        and impacts over the life of the landscape including preparing the site, purchasing
        and installing materials, annual maintenance and operations, and replacing
        landscape features and components that wear out or die. A variety of program
        options allow the user to select the planting and mulch materials and coverage,
        structures, irrigation systems, equipment, and to tailor the analysis to site-specific
        conditions.  Users can simultaneously compare up to three different landscapes.
        \nData to support the spreadsheet program was gathered from the scientific
        literature, nurseries, websites of manufacturers and home building supply
        stores, extension publications, and landscape cost estimate reports.  Cache
        Valley and Wasatch Front arborists, landscapers, and Cooperative Extension
        professionals also provided information specific to their expertise.  Because
        urban landscapes are complex systems, the spreadsheet program makes several
        simplifying assumptions.  Thus, spreadsheet program estimates of required
        inputs and impacts are accurate to within 30%.  Users should verify cost estimates
        with bids from landscape companies.  Given these estimation levels, use the
        spreadsheet program to compare the relative advantages and tradeoffs among
        different landscapes. We demonstrate use of the spreadsheet program for three
        landscapes at the Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District (JVWCD) conservation
        garden. These landscapes are the Traditional Landscape that has a large area
        of cool-season turfgrass, shrubs, perennials, ground cover, and common shade
        trees; the Perennial Landscape that has mostly drought-tolerant perennials
        and annuals; and the Woodland Landscape that consists largely of drought-tolerant
        shrubs and trees. To verify spreadsheet program results, we compare spreadsheet
        program estimates of water, labor, fertilizer, and fuel use in each landscape
        to observations made over 8 years by JVWCD garden staff.  Generally, spreadsheet
        program estimates and JVWCD staff observations agree within the 30% estimation
        level for the spreadsheet program. Homeowners, commercial property owners,
        and landscapers can use the spreadsheet program to identify the total costs,
        water use, and other required inputs for their landscape choices.  The program
        can identify tradeoffs in costs, inputs, and impacts among an existing (or
        planned) landscape and modifications to it.  By examining results and changing
        the landscape design, the user can develop a landscape plan that should cost
        less and require less water, labor, fertilizers, and other inputs.\n\nThe

        David","abstract":"The Value Landscape Engineering (VLE) spreadsheet program
        identifies the costs, labor, water, fertilizers, pesticides, energy, and fuel
        required to install and maintain a residential or commercial landscape in
        Utah. The program also identifies the carbon footprint and particulates generated
        from landscape installation and maintenance activities.  VLE considers all
        activities associated with a particular landscape over its life with the goal
        to maximize value and reduce required inputs. The VLE spreadsheet program
        tabulates all onsite costs, inputs, and impacts over the life of the landscape
        including preparing the site, purchasing and installing materials, annual
        maintenance and operations, and replacing landscape features and components
        that wear out or die. A variety of program options allow the user to select
        the planting and mulch materials and coverage, structures, irrigation systems,
        equipment, and to tailor the analysis to site-specific conditions.  Users
        can simultaneously compare up to three different landscapes. \nData to support
        the spreadsheet program was gathered from the scientific literature, nurseries,
        websites of manufacturers and home building supply stores, extension publications,
        and landscape cost estimate reports.  Cache Valley and Wasatch Front arborists,
        landscapers, and Cooperative Extension professionals also provided information
        specific to their expertise.  Because urban landscapes are complex systems,
        the spreadsheet program makes several simplifying assumptions.  Thus, spreadsheet
        program estimates of required inputs and impacts are accurate to within 30%.  Users
        should verify cost estimates with bids from landscape companies.  Given these
        estimation levels, use the spreadsheet program to compare the relative advantages
        and tradeoffs among different landscapes. We demonstrate use of the spreadsheet
        program for three landscapes at the Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District
        (JVWCD) conservation garden. These landscapes are the Traditional Landscape

        Counties: Sensitivity to Water Hazards \n CompositeResource This dataset contains
        important categories (per an extensive literature review) in relation to vulnerability
        to water hazards within Utah at the County level. Although social and physical
        vulnerability to water hazards (i.e. flooding) data has been collected extensively
        in many coastal areas, this is a costly problem in Utah and many other non-coastal
        areas. The variables shown here are categorized by type and collection method.
        1. General data is shown for all Counties in Utah. These are taken from the
        2010 Census. 2. Literature suggests that there are various approaches which
        local governments take to mitigate the impacts of flood events. Indicators
        of these approaches are captured in the section entitled Web Survey. A web
        survey was conducted of each County. The data includes evaluations of content
        including water hazard education, land use restrictions described in the code,
        freeboard requirements, and emergency operations plan implementations. 3.
        A social vulnerability index as created by the University of South Carolina
        is shown here. More information can be found at their website. 4. Event data
        is summarized for number of events and estimated monetary damages. This NOAA
        dataset helps us understand the nature of past experience and physical exposure
        to water hazards. Utah&#39;s Hazard Mitigation Plan 2014 includes a flood
        vulnerability score. It is included here for reference but is not critiqued
        as part of this dataset. 5. Fema has modeling software known as HAZUS which
        can be used to estimate damages for certain hazards including flooding. A
        county level summary is included here with estimated of building damage and
        exposure. 6. Dams are a man-made structure which play a part on flood management
        and can also create additional exposure. 7. Much of social vulnerability and
        disaster management should consider those with special needs. Census and the
        Division of Hazard Mitigation of Utah help us understand more of this important
        context.\n\nTogether these data paint a picture of Utah&#39;s vulnerabilities
        to flood hazards and potential exposure to other natural hazard events. Place
        level statistics were also collected and add insight at that spatial scale.
        they can be found here: http://repository.iutahepscor.org/dataset/hazard-mitigation-and-capacity-in-utah-census-places.

        Solute Chemistry \n CompositeResource This dataset includes stream solute
        concentrations measured in the Utah Lake Watershed. Because synoptic sampling
        requires rapid data collection in a short period of time, we used a citizen
        science approach to collect over 200 water samples in a single day. Samples
        were collected over three citizen science synoptic water sampling events which
        were conducted in March (Spring), July (Summer), and October (Fall) 2018.
        Volunteers were trained in person on the day of sampling and were provided
        with site coordinates, detailed written instructions, and sampling materials.
        Upon completion of sampling, participants returned their sampling kits, samples
        were manually inspected for quality control and any samples with incomplete
        data or other irregularities were discarded. Samples were filtered in the
        field with DI water-rinsed 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filters (Millipore Millex-GV)
        and immediately frozen or refrigerated and analyzed within 2 weeks of sampling.
        Anions (NO^3-, NO^2-, SO[4] ^2-, Cl-, and PO[4] ^3-) and cations (NH^4+) were
        quantified by ion chromatography (Dionex Thermofisher HPIC). Soluble reactive
        phosphorus was quantified colorimetrically using the ascorbic acid method
        (ref). We assumed phosphorus concentrations to be equal to the average of
        both the values determined by ion chromatography and ascorbic acid methods.
        Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TN) were quantified
        using a C/N auto-analyzer (Elementar, Ronkonkoma, NY). Dissolved inorganic
        nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as the sum of N species (i.e. NO^3-, NO^2-,
        and NH^4+) from the ion chromatography analysis. We used the application USGS
        StreamStats to delineate watersheds and calculate watershed area (km2). The
        application also calculates percent land cover from the National Land Cover
        Database (NLCD) 1992 and 2011, classified as forested, developed, impervious

        Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) CompositeResource The construction of Flaming Gorge
        Dam in 1964 caused significant changes to the channel form and juvenile fish
        habitat. To mitigate for degraded habitat, spring high flow dam operations
        were changed to improve juvenile off-channel habitat for razorback sucker.
        In this study, we evaluated whether these environmental spring flow releases
        can be met with future hydrology that incorporates climate change.  We found
        that the model performed poorly in years with an average spring runoff and
        well in dry, moderately dry, and wet years regardless of whether climate change
        was considered.  Next, we sought to increase the reliability of meeting environmental
        flow recommendations by adjusting the threshold values that define the hydrologic
        classification for each year and days at power plant capacity. We found that
        changing the threshold for each hydrologic classification was more sensitive
        than changing days at power plant capacity and that only by making extreme

        Random Forest Classification to generate Better Wet Area Maps from High Resolution
        Digital Elevation Models: a Study in a Boreal Forest Landscape \n CompositeResource
        Forested wetlands and wet soils near streams and lakes are often missing from
        current maps which makes wet areas difficult to manage. Wet soils also have
        lower bearing capacity making them more susceptible to soil disturbance from
        heavy forestry machines resulting in sediment and mercury transport to nearby
        surface waters. Topographical modelling of hydrological features such as topographical
        wetness index and depth to water has been suggested as a solution to this
        problem. These methods are easy to implement on large scales but are also
        static and do not take differences in spatial runoff patterns or soil textures
        into account. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate if machine learning
        can be used to create more accurate maps of wet soils. We used a machine learning
        approach where the National Forest Inventory of Sweden was used to train two
        random forest classifiers. The first model used a number of topographically
        derived variables along with soil types and runoff data while the second model
        only used topographically derived variables. The predicted maps were evaluated
        using Cohen’s kappa index of agreement, out of bag error and visual inspection
        of the Krycklan catchment. Both the predicted maps had a substantial agreement
        with the field plots and agreed well with the authors’ first-hand knowledge
        of the Krycklan catchment. Additionally there was sufficient information in
        the digital elevation model and including additional factors such as quaternary
        deposits and runoff only improved the overall accuracy by 1 % and increased

        The NHDPlus version 2 provides a robust geospatial hydrologic modeling framework
        for the United States (except Alaska) that is being used in many different
        applications. The NHDPlus High Resolution will provide even greater detail
        and will extend the framework to include Alaska and adds contributing streams
        and areas in Canada and Mexico. All versions of NHDPlus include a set of Value-Added
        Attributes (VAAs) which greatly improve the capabilities for upstream and
        downstream navigation, analysis, and modeling. Examples of these enhanced
        capabilities include using structured queries for rapid retrieval of all NHDFlowline
        features and catchments upstream of a selected NHDFlowline feature; selecting
        stream segments (sorted in hydrologic order) for stream profile analysis and
        plotting; and calculating cumulative catchment attributes using hydrologic
        sequence routing attributes. VAA-based routing methods were used to produce
        NHDPlus HR attributes such as cumulative drainage areas.\n\nThis workshop
        will introduce the concepts behind the NHDPlus VAAs and show how they may
        be used in hydrologic analyses. The workshop will include in-depth examples
        and demonstrations. Attendees are welcome to follow along on their own laptop,
        but this is not a hands-on workshop. Open source code repositories containing
        useful tools, source code, and programming specifications will be introduced.
        A major goal of the workshop is to begin to build a community around these

        system operated by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic
        Science, Inc. (CUAHSI). Within HydroShare, users can create and share data
        and models using a variety of file formats and flexible metadata. HydroShare
        enables users to formally publish these resources as well as create linkages
        between published data and model resources and peer reviewed journal publications
        that describe them. Ability to link published data and models with the papers
        that describe them is a great step in the direction of scientific reproducibility,

        scientific process by enabling scripting of analytical steps via a RESTful
        application programming interface (API). Using this API, HydroShare users
        can develop scripts to read data from HydroShare, perform an analytical step
        (e.g., data processing or visualization), and then write results back to HydroShare.
        The script itself can then be shared as part of the published dataset in HydroShare,
        or it can be shared as a Jupyter Notebook that can be executed within the
        HydroShare environment. Scripts or Jupyter Notebooks can then be executed

        present one of the first studies of the use of distributed temperature sensing
        (DTS) along fibre-optic cables to purposely monitor spatial and temporal variations
        in ground surface temperature (GST) and soil temperature, and provide an estimate
        of the heat flux at the base of the canopy layer and in the soil. Our field
        site was at a groundwater-fed wet meadow in the Netherlands covered by a canopy
        layer (between 0 and 0.5 m thickness) consisting of grass and sedges. At this
        site, we ran a single cable across the surface in parallel 40 m sections spaced
        by 2 m, to create a 40 m × 40 m monitoring field for GST. We also buried a
        short length (≈10 m) of cable to depth of 0.1 ± 0.02 m to measure soil temperature.
        We monitored the temperature along the entire cable continuously over a two-day
        period and captured the diurnal course of GST, and how it was affected by
        rainfall and canopy structure. The diurnal GST range, as observed by the DTS
        system, varied between 20.94 and 35.08 °C; precipitation events acted to suppress
        the range of GST. The spatial distribution of GST correlated with canopy vegetation
        height during both day and night. Using estimates of thermal inertia, combined
        with a harmonic analysis of GST and soil temperature, substrate- and soil-heat
        fluxes were determined. Our observations demonstrate how the use of DTS shows
        great promise in better characterizing area-average substrate/soil heat flux,
        their spatiotemporal variability, and how this variability is affected by
        canopy structure. The DTS system is able to provide a much richer data set

        inundation mapping and determining river hydraulic geometry \n CompositeResource
        River hydraulic geometry is an important input to hydraulic and hydrologic
        models that route flow along streams, determine the relationship between stage
        and discharge, and map the potential for flood inundation give the flow in
        a stream reach.  Traditional approaches to quantify river geometry have involved
        river cross-sections, such as are required for input to the HEC-RAS model.  Extending
        such cross-section based models to large scales has proven complex, and, in
        this presentation, an alternative approach, the Height Above Nearest Drainage,
        or HAND, is described.  As we have implemented it, HAND uses multi-directional
        flow directions derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) using the Dinifinity
        method in TauDEM software (http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem) to determine the
        height of each grid cell above the nearest stream along the flow path from
        that cell to the stream.  With this information, and the depth of flow in
        the stream, the potential for and depth of flood inundation can be determined.  Furthermore,
        by dividing streams into reaches or segments, the area draining to each reach
        can be isolated and a series of threshold depths applied to the grid of HAND
        values in that isolated reach catchment, to determine inundation volume, surface
        area and wetted bed area.  Dividing these by length yields reach average cross
        section area, width, and wetted perimeter.  Together with slope (also determined
        from the DEM) and roughness (Manning&#39;s n) these provide all the inputs
        needed for establishing a Manning&#39;s equation uniform flow assumption stage-discharge
        rating curve and for mapping potential inundation from discharge.  This presentation
        will describe the application of this approach across the continental US in
        conjunction with NOAA’s National Water Model for prediction of stage and flood
        inundation potential in each of the 2.7 million reaches of the National Hydrography
        Plus (NHDPlus) dataset, the vast majority of which are ungauged.  The continental
        US scale application has been enabled through the use of high performance
        parallel computing at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications

        that cell to the stream.  With this information, and the depth of flow in
        the stream, the potential for and depth of flood inundation can be determined.  Furthermore,
        by dividing streams into reaches or segments, the area draining to each reach
        can be isolated and a series of threshold depths applied to the grid of HAND
        values in that isolated reach catchment, to determine inundation volume, surface
        area and wetted bed area.  Dividing these by length yields reach average cross
        section area, width, and wetted perimeter.  Together with slope (also determined
        from the DEM) and roughness (Manning''s n) these provide all the inputs needed
        for establishing a Manning''s equation uniform flow assumption stage-discharge
        rating curve and for mapping potential inundation from discharge.  This presentation
        will describe the application of this approach across the continental US in
        conjunction with NOAA’s National Water Model for prediction of stage and flood
        inundation potential in each of the 2.7 million reaches of the National Hydrography
        Plus (NHDPlus) dataset, the vast majority of which are ungauged.  The continental
        US scale application has been enabled through the use of high performance
        parallel computing at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
        (NCSA) and the CyberGIS Center at the University of Illinois.\n\nPresentation

        employed Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Heat Source modeling to
        quantify the thermal regime of a one-kilometer section of the North Fork of
        the Salmon River, a tributary of the Klamath River, northern California, USA.
        The study collected eight days of temperature data using DTS at one-meter,
        15-minute intervals during July 2012. The research aimed to: 1) investigate
        the geomorphic and thermal conditions of the study reach and their impact
        on native Salmonids. 2) identify and quantify groundwater seeps; and 3) employ
        and calibrate Heat Source to predict effects of riparian management, channel
        geometry, and climate change on stream temperature over the study reach. DTS
        observations revealed nearly uniform warming over the study reach, a diel
        heating cycle of 5 °C, a small groundwater spring (7 % of mainstem flow),
        and a Maximum Weekly Maximum Temperature (MWMT) of 23.00 °C. Statistical modeling
        of salmonid distribution field observations with AICc found that depth was
        the most explanatory parameter. Habitat inventory of the study reach indicated
        poor salmonid habitat quality with low habitat complexity with no large woody
        debris or instream cover. Heat Source model performance (Bias, RMSE, MARE,
        and NSE), compared to DTS iii observations, were all within the range of previous
        Heat Source applications. Heat Source modeling of reforestation of denuded
        legacy gravel bars from historic gold mining and areas of low vegetation in
        the study reach indicated that reforestation buffered daily maximum stream
        temperatures. Modeled channel restoration scenarios reduced the rate of heating

        Veatch (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)\n\nThe assumption of hydrologic stationarity,
        that observed data from the past represents present and future conditions,
        has typically underpinned hydrologic and hydraulic design and planning. A
        growing body of scientific evidence is undermining that assumption, as certain
        variables critical to the design and evaluation of water resources projects
        are being impacted by climate change and anthropogenic watershed modifications
        such that future variability cannot necessarily be assumed to follow past
        observations. US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) projects must, as a matter
        of policy, be designed for the full range of plausible future conditions that
        can be expected throughout their intended design lives, despite uncertainty
        regarding the exact nature of those future conditions. USACE has therefore
        released revised technical guidance related to the identification of observed
        changes and projection of potential future changes in hydro-climatic conditions.
        In addition to the written guidance, USACE has developed web applications
        that make it easier for water resources professionals to apply the techniques
        described in the guidance in a technically correct, timely, and reproducible
        manner. In this talk, USACE policy and technical guidance related to the incorporation
        of climate change impacts into hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for both
        coastal and inland waterways will be outlined, along with the web-based tools
        created to help implement these analyses. After attending this talk, the audience

        the potential of a fiber optic cable connected to distributed temperature
        sensing (DTS) technology to withstand wildland fire conditions and quantify
        fire behavior parameters. We used a custom-made ‘fire cable’ consisting of

        prescribed fires. The DTS system recorded fire cable output every three seconds
        and integrated temperatures every 50.6 cm. Results indicated the fire cable
        was physically capable of withstanding repeated rugged use. Fiber coating
        materials withstood temperatures up to 422 °C. Changes in fiber attenuation
        following fire were near zero (−0.81 to 0.12 dB/km) indicating essentially
        no change in light gain or loss as a function of distance or fire intensity

        in central and western Mississippi, encompassing approximately 13,500 square
        miles of drainage area (30% of the total area of the state of Mississippi).
        The authorized purpose of the four basin lakes is flood control. Other benefits
        are derived from the operation of the reservoirs, such as recreation, improved
        fish and wildlife habitat, and incidental navigation. The Flood Control Act
        of 15 June 1936 authorized the construction of the reservoirs within the Yazoo
        Basin. Construction began in the 1940’s and lasted through the 1950’s. All
        reservoirs were in operation by 1954.\nThere are two main topographic sections
        in the basin: the hill section and the delta section. The hill section above
        the lakes is fan shaped and is a rolling to hilly region with moderate variations
        on elevations. Soils in the uplands are composed chiefly of clays and loams
        and are moderately productive but subject to severe erosion. Alluvial soils
        in the stream valleys are fertile and generally cleared for cultivation. Vegetation

        CWMS - Willamette Watershed \n CollectionResource The Corps Water Management
        System (CWMS) includes four interrelated models to assist with water management
        for the basin:\n- GeoHMS (Geospatial Hydrologic Modeling Extension)\n- ResSIM
        (Reservoir System Simulation)\n- RAS (River Analysis System)\n- FIA (Flood
        Impact Analysis)\n\nThe Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia
        River, is 187 miles long. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range
        and Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form a basin called the Willamette
        Valley. The valley, fed by rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, is
        one of the most fertile agriculture regions of the United States.\nThe main
        stem of the Willamette River is formed by the confluence of the Middle and
        Coast Forks of the Willamette River near Springfield, Oregon. The main stem
        flows north for 187 miles to the Columbia River. Significant tributaries of
        the Willamette River, from source to mouth, include the Middle and Coast Fork
        Willamette, the McKenzie, Long Tom, Marys, Calapooia, Santiam, Luckiamute,
        Yamhill, Molalla, Tualatin, and Clackamas rivers. The main stem of the Willamette
        River has an elevation of 438 feet at its headwaters and loses 428 feet in
        elevation between source and mouth or about 2.3 feet per mile. The gradient
        is slightly steeper from the source to Albany than from Albany to Oregon City.
        The main stem of the Willamette varies in width from about 330 to 660 feet.
        The average flow at the mouth is approximately 32,400 cubic feet per second
        and contributes 12 to 15 percent of the total flow of the Columbia River.
        The Willamette’s flow varies seasonally, averaging about 8,200 cfs in August
        to more than 79,000 cfs in December.\nThe Willamette River basin contains
        thirteen USACE dams. The primary purpose of these projects is to prevent flood
        damages to the downstream metropolitan areas of the Willamette Valley but
        other purposes include hydropower generation, fish and wildlife, water quality,
        recreational use and water supply. The regulation of flood and conservation
        storage in each reservoir is coordinated with the regulation of storage in
        all of the other reservoirs in the basin.\nCommunities along the main stem
        at risk of flooding include Springfield and Eugene in Lane County; Harrisburg
        in Linn County; Corvallis in Benton County; Albany in Linn and Benton Counties;
        Salem in Marion County; Newberg in Yamhill County; Oregon City, West Linn,
        Milwaukie, and Lake Oswego in Clackamas County, and Portland in Multnomah
        and Washington counties. The Willamette River is known for flooding because
        of the high amounts and variations of precipitation in the valley. The largest
        flood on the Willamette River, in recorded history, occurred in 1861 when
        rainstorms and warm temperatures combined with a well-above-average snowpack
        in the Cascades. From Eugene to Portland, thousands of acres of riverside
        farmland were washed away and many towns in the valley were damaged or destroyed.
        Peaking at 635,000 cubic feet per second, the 1861 flood inundated approximately
        353,000 acres of land. Although the Willamette River is regulated and controlled
        by a complex system of dams, severe flooding is still a concern. In 1996,
        a low elevation snowpack combined with massive rainfall and warm temperatures,
        caused some of the costliest floods to ever affect the Willamette Valley.

        Corps Water Management System (CWMS) includes four interrelated models to
        assist with water management for the basin:\n- GeoHMS (Geospatial Hydrologic
        Modeling Extension)\n- ResSIM (Reservoir System Simulation)\n- RAS (River
        Analysis System)\n- FIA (Flood Impact Analysis)\n\nThe Willamette River, a
        major tributary of the Columbia River, is 187 miles long. Flowing northward
        between the Oregon Coast Range and Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries
        form a basin called the Willamette Valley. The valley, fed by rainfall on
        the western side of the Cascades, is one of the most fertile agriculture regions
        of the United States.\nThe main stem of the Willamette River is formed by
        the confluence of the Middle and Coast Forks of the Willamette River near
        Springfield, Oregon. The main stem flows north for 187 miles to the Columbia
        River. Significant tributaries of the Willamette River, from source to mouth,
        include the Middle and Coast Fork Willamette, the McKenzie, Long Tom, Marys,
        Calapooia, Santiam, Luckiamute, Yamhill, Molalla, Tualatin, and Clackamas
        rivers. The main stem of the Willamette River has an elevation of 438 feet
        at its headwaters and loses 428 feet in elevation between source and mouth
        or about 2.3 feet per mile. The gradient is slightly steeper from the source
        to Albany than from Albany to Oregon City. The main stem of the Willamette
        varies in width from about 330 to 660 feet. The average flow at the mouth
        is approximately 32,400 cubic feet per second and contributes 12 to 15 percent
        of the total flow of the Columbia River. The Willamette’s flow varies seasonally,
        averaging about 8,200 cfs in August to more than 79,000 cfs in December.\nThe
        Willamette River basin contains thirteen USACE dams. The primary purpose of
        these projects is to prevent flood damages to the downstream metropolitan
        areas of the Willamette Valley but other purposes include hydropower generation,
        fish and wildlife, water quality, recreational use and water supply. The regulation
        of flood and conservation storage in each reservoir is coordinated with the
        regulation of storage in all of the other reservoirs in the basin.\nCommunities
        along the main stem at risk of flooding include Springfield and Eugene in
        Lane County; Harrisburg in Linn County; Corvallis in Benton County; Albany
        in Linn and Benton Counties; Salem in Marion County; Newberg in Yamhill County;
        Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, and Lake Oswego in Clackamas County, and
        Portland in Multnomah and Washington counties. The Willamette River is known
        for flooding because of the high amounts and variations of precipitation in
        the valley. The largest flood on the Willamette River, in recorded history,
        occurred in 1861 when rainstorms and warm temperatures combined with a well-above-average
        snowpack in the Cascades. From Eugene to Portland, thousands of acres of riverside
        farmland were washed away and many towns in the valley were damaged or destroyed.
        Peaking at 635,000 cubic feet per second, the 1861 flood inundated approximately
        353,000 acres of land. Although the Willamette River is regulated and controlled
        by a complex system of dams, severe flooding is still a concern. In 1996,
        a low elevation snowpack combined with massive rainfall and warm temperatures,
        caused some of the costliest floods to ever affect the Willamette Valley.","contributor":null,"subject":["Corps

        System)\n- FIA (Flood Impact Analysis)\n\nThe West Branch Susquehanna River
        Watershed covers almost 7000 square miles in central and north-central Pennsylvania.
        The upper or western part of the watershed lies mainly in the Appalachian
        Plateau Physiographic Province and is generally characterized by narrow flat-bottomed
        valleys with steep walls rising to rolling plateaus. Low mountains typically
        range up to 2500 feet in elevation. Most of the area is forested, with numerous
        state parks, state forests, and state game lands. Stream gradients along the
        main stem West Branch Susquehanna River in this portion of the watershed average
        about 6 feet per mile. Some tributary streams, however, have gradients that
        exceed 15 to 20 feet per mile, contributing to quick increases in runoff during
        intense storms or rapid snowmelt events. The eastern part of the watershed
        lies mainly in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province. Stream gradients
        along the main stem West Branch Susquehanna River in this lower portion of
        the watershed flatten out and average about 2 feet per mile. Valley portions
        are devoted mainly to agriculture.\nIn addition to the West Branch Susquehanna
        River, major tributary streams in the watershed include Clearfield Creek,
        Moshannon Creek, Bald Eagle Creek, Sinnemahoning Creek, Kettle Creek, Pine
        Creek, Lycoming Creek, Loyalsock Creek and Muncy Creek. There are only two
        major population centers in the watershed. Williamsport has a population of
        almost 30,000 and Lock Haven has a population of almost 10,000; both cities
        are located on the banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River. Most other
        towns in the watershed have populations less than 5,000 people, with many
        being located adjacent to tributary streams and the main stem West Branch
        Susquehanna River.\nThe four reservoir projects in the watershed are regulated
        as a system for flood risk management along the West Branch Susquehanna River.
        Taken together, these four projects have generated over $860 million in flood
        damage reduction benefits over the past 50 years. Each reservoir also provides
        water-oriented recreational features such as beaches, boat launches, fishing
        facilities, camping areas, and picnic zones that are managed by state and
        local sponsors. Portions of the West Branch Susquehanna watershed are degraded
        by acid mine drainage from abandoned coal mines, and the Curwensville and
        Sayers projects are occasionally regulated to mitigate the adverse effects
        of acid mine drainage along the West Branch Susquehanna River. In addition,
        Curwensville Lake provides 5240 acre-feet of dedicated water supply storage

        and impacts over the life of the landscape including preparing the site, purchasing
        and installing materials, annual maintenance and operations, and replacing
        landscape features and components that wear out or die. A variety of program
        options allow the user to select the planting and mulch materials and coverage,
        structures, irrigation systems, equipment, and to tailor the analysis to site-specific
        conditions.  Users can simultaneously compare up to three different landscapes.
        \nData to support the spreadsheet program was gathered from the scientific
        literature, nurseries, websites of manufacturers and home building supply
        stores, extension publications, and landscape cost estimate reports.  Cache
        Valley and Wasatch Front arborists, landscapers, and Cooperative Extension
        professionals also provided information specific to their expertise.  Because
        urban landscapes are complex systems, the spreadsheet program makes several
        simplifying assumptions.  Thus, spreadsheet program estimates of required
        inputs and impacts are accurate to within 30%.  Users should verify cost estimates
        with bids from landscape companies.  Given these estimation levels, use the
        spreadsheet program to compare the relative advantages and tradeoffs among
        different landscapes. We demonstrate use of the spreadsheet program for three
        landscapes at the Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District (JVWCD) conservation
        garden. These landscapes are the Traditional Landscape that has a large area
        of cool-season turfgrass, shrubs, perennials, ground cover, and common shade
        trees; the Perennial Landscape that has mostly drought-tolerant perennials
        and annuals; and the Woodland Landscape that consists largely of drought-tolerant
        shrubs and trees. To verify spreadsheet program results, we compare spreadsheet
        program estimates of water, labor, fertilizer, and fuel use in each landscape
        to observations made over 8 years by JVWCD garden staff.  Generally, spreadsheet
        program estimates and JVWCD staff observations agree within the 30% estimation
        level for the spreadsheet program. Homeowners, commercial property owners,
        and landscapers can use the spreadsheet program to identify the total costs,
        water use, and other required inputs for their landscape choices.  The program
        can identify tradeoffs in costs, inputs, and impacts among an existing (or
        planned) landscape and modifications to it.  By examining results and changing
        the landscape design, the user can develop a landscape plan that should cost
        less and require less water, labor, fertilizers, and other inputs.\n\nThe

        Counties: Sensitivity to Water Hazards \n CompositeResource This dataset contains
        important categories (per an extensive literature review) in relation to vulnerability
        to water hazards within Utah at the County level. Although social and physical
        vulnerability to water hazards (i.e. flooding) data has been collected extensively
        in many coastal areas, this is a costly problem in Utah and many other non-coastal
        areas. The variables shown here are categorized by type and collection method.
        1. General data is shown for all Counties in Utah. These are taken from the
        2010 Census. 2. Literature suggests that there are various approaches which
        local governments take to mitigate the impacts of flood events. Indicators
        of these approaches are captured in the section entitled Web Survey. A web
        survey was conducted of each County. The data includes evaluations of content
        including water hazard education, land use restrictions described in the code,
        freeboard requirements, and emergency operations plan implementations. 3.
        A social vulnerability index as created by the University of South Carolina
        is shown here. More information can be found at their website. 4. Event data
        is summarized for number of events and estimated monetary damages. This NOAA
        dataset helps us understand the nature of past experience and physical exposure
        to water hazards. Utah&#39;s Hazard Mitigation Plan 2014 includes a flood
        vulnerability score. It is included here for reference but is not critiqued
        as part of this dataset. 5. Fema has modeling software known as HAZUS which
        can be used to estimate damages for certain hazards including flooding. A
        county level summary is included here with estimated of building damage and
        exposure. 6. Dams are a man-made structure which play a part on flood management
        and can also create additional exposure. 7. Much of social vulnerability and
        disaster management should consider those with special needs. Census and the
        Division of Hazard Mitigation of Utah help us understand more of this important
        context.\n\nTogether these data paint a picture of Utah&#39;s vulnerabilities
        to flood hazards and potential exposure to other natural hazard events. Place
        level statistics were also collected and add insight at that spatial scale.

        Solute Chemistry \n CompositeResource This dataset includes stream solute
        concentrations measured in the Utah Lake Watershed. Because synoptic sampling
        requires rapid data collection in a short period of time, we used a citizen
        science approach to collect over 200 water samples in a single day. Samples
        were collected over three citizen science synoptic water sampling events which
        were conducted in March (Spring), July (Summer), and October (Fall) 2018.
        Volunteers were trained in person on the day of sampling and were provided
        with site coordinates, detailed written instructions, and sampling materials.
        Upon completion of sampling, participants returned their sampling kits, samples
        were manually inspected for quality control and any samples with incomplete
        data or other irregularities were discarded. Samples were filtered in the
        field with DI water-rinsed 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filters (Millipore Millex-GV)
        and immediately frozen or refrigerated and analyzed within 2 weeks of sampling.
        Anions (NO^3-, NO^2-, SO[4] ^2-, Cl-, and PO[4] ^3-) and cations (NH^4+) were
        quantified by ion chromatography (Dionex Thermofisher HPIC). Soluble reactive
        phosphorus was quantified colorimetrically using the ascorbic acid method
        (ref). We assumed phosphorus concentrations to be equal to the average of
        both the values determined by ion chromatography and ascorbic acid methods.
        Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TN) were quantified
        using a C/N auto-analyzer (Elementar, Ronkonkoma, NY). Dissolved inorganic
        nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as the sum of N species (i.e. NO^3-, NO^2-,
        and NH^4+) from the ion chromatography analysis. We used the application USGS
        StreamStats to delineate watersheds and calculate watershed area (km2). The
        application also calculates percent land cover from the National Land Cover
        Database (NLCD) 1992 and 2011, classified as forested, developed, impervious

        Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) CompositeResource The construction of Flaming Gorge
        Dam in 1964 caused significant changes to the channel form and juvenile fish
        habitat. To mitigate for degraded habitat, spring high flow dam operations
        were changed to improve juvenile off-channel habitat for razorback sucker.
        In this study, we evaluated whether these environmental spring flow releases
        can be met with future hydrology that incorporates climate change.  We found
        that the model performed poorly in years with an average spring runoff and
        well in dry, moderately dry, and wet years regardless of whether climate change
        was considered.  Next, we sought to increase the reliability of meeting environmental
        flow recommendations by adjusting the threshold values that define the hydrologic
        classification for each year and days at power plant capacity. We found that
        changing the threshold for each hydrologic classification was more sensitive
        than changing days at power plant capacity and that only by making extreme

        Random Forest Classification to generate Better Wet Area Maps from High Resolution
        Digital Elevation Models: a Study in a Boreal Forest Landscape \n CompositeResource
        Forested wetlands and wet soils near streams and lakes are often missing from
        current maps which makes wet areas difficult to manage. Wet soils also have
        lower bearing capacity making them more susceptible to soil disturbance from
        heavy forestry machines resulting in sediment and mercury transport to nearby
        surface waters. Topographical modelling of hydrological features such as topographical
        wetness index and depth to water has been suggested as a solution to this
        problem. These methods are easy to implement on large scales but are also
        static and do not take differences in spatial runoff patterns or soil textures
        into account. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate if machine learning
        can be used to create more accurate maps of wet soils. We used a machine learning
        approach where the National Forest Inventory of Sweden was used to train two
        random forest classifiers. The first model used a number of topographically
        derived variables along with soil types and runoff data while the second model
        only used topographically derived variables. The predicted maps were evaluated
        using Cohen’s kappa index of agreement, out of bag error and visual inspection
        of the Krycklan catchment. Both the predicted maps had a substantial agreement
        with the field plots and agreed well with the authors’ first-hand knowledge
        of the Krycklan catchment. Additionally there was sufficient information in
        the digital elevation model and including additional factors such as quaternary
        deposits and runoff only improved the overall accuracy by 1 % and increased

        The NHDPlus version 2 provides a robust geospatial hydrologic modeling framework
        for the United States (except Alaska) that is being used in many different
        applications. The NHDPlus High Resolution will provide even greater detail
        and will extend the framework to include Alaska and adds contributing streams
        and areas in Canada and Mexico. All versions of NHDPlus include a set of Value-Added
        Attributes (VAAs) which greatly improve the capabilities for upstream and
        downstream navigation, analysis, and modeling. Examples of these enhanced
        capabilities include using structured queries for rapid retrieval of all NHDFlowline
        features and catchments upstream of a selected NHDFlowline feature; selecting
        stream segments (sorted in hydrologic order) for stream profile analysis and
        plotting; and calculating cumulative catchment attributes using hydrologic
        sequence routing attributes. VAA-based routing methods were used to produce
        NHDPlus HR attributes such as cumulative drainage areas.\n\nThis workshop
        will introduce the concepts behind the NHDPlus VAAs and show how they may
        be used in hydrologic analyses. The workshop will include in-depth examples
        and demonstrations. Attendees are welcome to follow along on their own laptop,
        but this is not a hands-on workshop. Open source code repositories containing
        useful tools, source code, and programming specifications will be introduced.
        A major goal of the workshop is to begin to build a community around these

        system operated by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic
        Science, Inc. (CUAHSI). Within HydroShare, users can create and share data
        and models using a variety of file formats and flexible metadata. HydroShare
        enables users to formally publish these resources as well as create linkages
        between published data and model resources and peer reviewed journal publications

        can develop scripts to read data from HydroShare, perform an analytical step
        (e.g., data processing or visualization), and then write results back to HydroShare.
        The script itself can then be shared as part of the published dataset in HydroShare,

        present one of the first studies of the use of distributed temperature sensing
        (DTS) along fibre-optic cables to purposely monitor spatial and temporal variations
        in ground surface temperature (GST) and soil temperature, and provide an estimate
        of the heat flux at the base of the canopy layer and in the soil. Our field
        site was at a groundwater-fed wet meadow in the Netherlands covered by a canopy
        layer (between 0 and 0.5 m thickness) consisting of grass and sedges. At this
        site, we ran a single cable across the surface in parallel 40 m sections spaced
        by 2 m, to create a 40 m × 40 m monitoring field for GST. We also buried a
        short length (≈10 m) of cable to depth of 0.1 ± 0.02 m to measure soil temperature.
        We monitored the temperature along the entire cable continuously over a two-day
        period and captured the diurnal course of GST, and how it was affected by
        rainfall and canopy structure. The diurnal GST range, as observed by the DTS
        system, varied between 20.94 and 35.08 °C; precipitation events acted to suppress
        the range of GST. The spatial distribution of GST correlated with canopy vegetation
        height during both day and night. Using estimates of thermal inertia, combined
        with a harmonic analysis of GST and soil temperature, substrate- and soil-heat
        fluxes were determined. Our observations demonstrate how the use of DTS shows
        great promise in better characterizing area-average substrate/soil heat flux,
        their spatiotemporal variability, and how this variability is affected by
        canopy structure. The DTS system is able to provide a much richer data set

        Digital Elevation Model Derived Height Above the Nearest Drainage for flood
        inundation mapping and determining river hydraulic geometry \n CompositeResource
        River hydraulic geometry is an important input to hydraulic and hydrologic
        models that route flow along streams, determine the relationship between stage
        and discharge, and map the potential for flood inundation give the flow in
        a stream reach.  Traditional approaches to quantify river geometry have involved
        river cross-sections, such as are required for input to the HEC-RAS model.  Extending
        such cross-section based models to large scales has proven complex, and, in
        this presentation, an alternative approach, the Height Above Nearest Drainage,
        or HAND, is described.  As we have implemented it, HAND uses multi-directional
        flow directions derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) using the Dinifinity
        method in TauDEM software (http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem) to determine the
        height of each grid cell above the nearest stream along the flow path from
        that cell to the stream.  With this information, and the depth of flow in
        the stream, the potential for and depth of flood inundation can be determined.  Furthermore,
        by dividing streams into reaches or segments, the area draining to each reach
        can be isolated and a series of threshold depths applied to the grid of HAND
        values in that isolated reach catchment, to determine inundation volume, surface
        area and wetted bed area.  Dividing these by length yields reach average cross
        section area, width, and wetted perimeter.  Together with slope (also determined
        from the DEM) and roughness (Manning&#39;s n) these provide all the inputs
        needed for establishing a Manning&#39;s equation uniform flow assumption stage-discharge
        rating curve and for mapping potential inundation from discharge.  This presentation
        will describe the application of this approach across the continental US in
        conjunction with NOAA’s National Water Model for prediction of stage and flood
        inundation potential in each of the 2.7 million reaches of the National Hydrography
        Plus (NHDPlus) dataset, the vast majority of which are ungauged.  The continental
        US scale application has been enabled through the use of high performance
        parallel computing at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
        (NCSA) and the CyberGIS Center at the University of Illinois.\n\nPresentation

        hydraulic geometry is an important input to hydraulic and hydrologic models
        that route flow along streams, determine the relationship between stage and
        discharge, and map the potential for flood inundation give the flow in a stream
        reach.  Traditional approaches to quantify river geometry have involved river
        cross-sections, such as are required for input to the HEC-RAS model.  Extending
        such cross-section based models to large scales has proven complex, and, in
        this presentation, an alternative approach, the Height Above Nearest Drainage,
        or HAND, is described.  As we have implemented it, HAND uses multi-directional
        flow directions derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) using the Dinifinity
        method in TauDEM software (http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem) to determine the
        height of each grid cell above the nearest stream along the flow path from
        that cell to the stream.  With this information, and the depth of flow in
        the stream, the potential for and depth of flood inundation can be determined.  Furthermore,
        by dividing streams into reaches or segments, the area draining to each reach
        can be isolated and a series of threshold depths applied to the grid of HAND
        values in that isolated reach catchment, to determine inundation volume, surface
        area and wetted bed area.  Dividing these by length yields reach average cross
        section area, width, and wetted perimeter.  Together with slope (also determined
        from the DEM) and roughness (Manning''s n) these provide all the inputs needed
        for establishing a Manning''s equation uniform flow assumption stage-discharge
        rating curve and for mapping potential inundation from discharge.  This presentation
        will describe the application of this approach across the continental US in
        conjunction with NOAA’s National Water Model for prediction of stage and flood
        inundation potential in each of the 2.7 million reaches of the National Hydrography
        Plus (NHDPlus) dataset, the vast majority of which are ungauged.  The continental
        US scale application has been enabled through the use of high performance
        parallel computing at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
        (NCSA) and the CyberGIS Center at the University of Illinois.\n\nPresentation

        employed Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Heat Source modeling to
        quantify the thermal regime of a one-kilometer section of the North Fork of
        the Salmon River, a tributary of the Klamath River, northern California, USA.
        The study collected eight days of temperature data using DTS at one-meter,
        15-minute intervals during July 2012. The research aimed to: 1) investigate
        the geomorphic and thermal conditions of the study reach and their impact
        on native Salmonids. 2) identify and quantify groundwater seeps; and 3) employ
        and calibrate Heat Source to predict effects of riparian management, channel
        geometry, and climate change on stream temperature over the study reach. DTS
        observations revealed nearly uniform warming over the study reach, a diel
        heating cycle of 5 °C, a small groundwater spring (7 % of mainstem flow),
        and a Maximum Weekly Maximum Temperature (MWMT) of 23.00 °C. Statistical modeling
        of salmonid distribution field observations with AICc found that depth was
        the most explanatory parameter. Habitat inventory of the study reach indicated
        poor salmonid habitat quality with low habitat complexity with no large woody
        debris or instream cover. Heat Source model performance (Bias, RMSE, MARE,
        and NSE), compared to DTS iii observations, were all within the range of previous
        Heat Source applications. Heat Source modeling of reforestation of denuded
        legacy gravel bars from historic gold mining and areas of low vegetation in
        the study reach indicated that reforestation buffered daily maximum stream
        temperatures. Modeled channel restoration scenarios reduced the rate of heating
        (ºC /90 m) in the treatment area by a maximum of 34 %. Climate changescenarios
        were simulated with a uniform increase of air temperature by 2 °C, 4 °C, and
        6 °C which warmed stream temperatures by 0.09 ºC / km per 2 ºC air temperature
        increase. Warming predicted by climate change was ameliorated with reforestation
        (0.11 ºC /km and 0.26 ºC per 2 ºC /km air temperature increase for partial

        Veatch (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)\n\nThe assumption of hydrologic stationarity,
        that observed data from the past represents present and future conditions,
        has typically underpinned hydrologic and hydraulic design and planning. A
        growing body of scientific evidence is undermining that assumption, as certain
        variables critical to the design and evaluation of water resources projects
        are being impacted by climate change and anthropogenic watershed modifications
        such that future variability cannot necessarily be assumed to follow past
        observations. US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) projects must, as a matter
        of policy, be designed for the full range of plausible future conditions that
        can be expected throughout their intended design lives, despite uncertainty
        regarding the exact nature of those future conditions. USACE has therefore
        released revised technical guidance related to the identification of observed
        changes and projection of potential future changes in hydro-climatic conditions.
        In addition to the written guidance, USACE has developed web applications
        that make it easier for water resources professionals to apply the techniques
        described in the guidance in a technically correct, timely, and reproducible
        manner. In this talk, USACE policy and technical guidance related to the incorporation
        of climate change impacts into hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for both

        \nda0028e530e545bfa70940fcfb57e546  Use of Distributed Temperature Sensing
        Technology to Characterize Fire Behavior \n CompositeResource We evaluated
        the potential of a fiber optic cable connected to distributed temperature
        sensing (DTS) technology to withstand wildland fire conditions and quantify
        fire behavior parameters. We used a custom-made ‘fire cable’ consisting of
        three optical fibers coated with three different materials—acrylate, copper
        and polyimide. The 150-m cable was deployed in grasslands and burned in three
        prescribed fires. The DTS system recorded fire cable output every three seconds
        and integrated temperatures every 50.6 cm. Results indicated the fire cable
        was physically capable of withstanding repeated rugged use. Fiber coating
        materials withstood temperatures up to 422 °C. Changes in fiber attenuation
        following fire were near zero (−0.81 to 0.12 dB/km) indicating essentially
        no change in light gain or loss as a function of distance or fire intensity
        over the length of the fire cable. Results indicated fire cable and DTS technology
        have potential to quantify fire environment parameters such as heat duration
        and rate of spread but additional experimentation and analysis are required
        to determine efficacy and response times. This study adds understanding of
        DTS and fire cable technology as a potential new method for characterizing
        fire behavior parameters at greater temporal and spatial scales.\n\nRaw project

        fire behavior parameters. We used a custom-made ‘fire cable’ consisting of
        three optical fibers coated with three different materials—acrylate, copper
        and polyimide. The 150-m cable was deployed in grasslands and burned in three
        prescribed fires. The DTS system recorded fire cable output every three seconds
        and integrated temperatures every 50.6 cm. Results indicated the fire cable
        was physically capable of withstanding repeated rugged use. Fiber coating
        materials withstood temperatures up to 422 °C. Changes in fiber attenuation
        following fire were near zero (−0.81 to 0.12 dB/km) indicating essentially
        no change in light gain or loss as a function of distance or fire intensity
        over the length of the fire cable. Results indicated fire cable and DTS technology
        have potential to quantify fire environment parameters such as heat duration
        and rate of spread but additional experimentation and analysis are required
        to determine efficacy and response times. This study adds understanding of
        DTS and fire cable technology as a potential new method for characterizing
        fire behavior parameters at greater temporal and spatial scales.\n\nRaw project

        Analysis System)\n- FIA (Flood Impact Analysis)\n\nThe Yazoo Basin is located
        in central and western Mississippi, encompassing approximately 13,500 square
        miles of drainage area (30% of the total area of the state of Mississippi).
        The authorized purpose of the four basin lakes is flood control. Other benefits
        are derived from the operation of the reservoirs, such as recreation, improved
        fish and wildlife habitat, and incidental navigation. The Flood Control Act
        of 15 June 1936 authorized the construction of the reservoirs within the Yazoo
        Basin. Construction began in the 1940’s and lasted through the 1950’s. All
        reservoirs were in operation by 1954.\nThere are two main topographic sections
        in the basin: the hill section and the delta section. The hill section above
        the lakes is fan shaped and is a rolling to hilly region with moderate variations
        on elevations. Soils in the uplands are composed chiefly of clays and loams
        and are moderately productive but subject to severe erosion. Alluvial soils
        in the stream valleys are fertile and generally cleared for cultivation. Vegetation

        CWMS - Willamette Watershed \n CollectionResource The Corps Water Management
        System (CWMS) includes four interrelated models to assist with water management
        for the basin:\n- GeoHMS (Geospatial Hydrologic Modeling Extension)\n- ResSIM
        (Reservoir System Simulation)\n- RAS (River Analysis System)\n- FIA (Flood
        Impact Analysis)\n\nThe Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia
        River, is 187 miles long. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range
        and Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form a basin called the Willamette
        Valley. The valley, fed by rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, is
        one of the most fertile agriculture regions of the United States.\nThe main
        stem of the Willamette River is formed by the confluence of the Middle and
        Coast Forks of the Willamette River near Springfield, Oregon. The main stem
        flows north for 187 miles to the Columbia River. Significant tributaries of
        the Willamette River, from source to mouth, include the Middle and Coast Fork
        Willamette, the McKenzie, Long Tom, Marys, Calapooia, Santiam, Luckiamute,
        Yamhill, Molalla, Tualatin, and Clackamas rivers. The main stem of the Willamette
        River has an elevation of 438 feet at its headwaters and loses 428 feet in
        elevation between source and mouth or about 2.3 feet per mile. The gradient
        is slightly steeper from the source to Albany than from Albany to Oregon City.
        The main stem of the Willamette varies in width from about 330 to 660 feet.
        The average flow at the mouth is approximately 32,400 cubic feet per second
        and contributes 12 to 15 percent of the total flow of the Columbia River.
        The Willamette’s flow varies seasonally, averaging about 8,200 cfs in August
        to more than 79,000 cfs in December.\nThe Willamette River basin contains
        thirteen USACE dams. The primary purpose of these projects is to prevent flood
        damages to the downstream metropolitan areas of the Willamette Valley but
        other purposes include hydropower generation, fish and wildlife, water quality,
        recreational use and water supply. The regulation of flood and conservation
        storage in each reservoir is coordinated with the regulation of storage in
        all of the other reservoirs in the basin.\nCommunities along the main stem
        at risk of flooding include Springfield and Eugene in Lane County; Harrisburg
        in Linn County; Corvallis in Benton County; Albany in Linn and Benton Counties;
        Salem in Marion County; Newberg in Yamhill County; Oregon City, West Linn,
        Milwaukie, and Lake Oswego in Clackamas County, and Portland in Multnomah
        and Washington counties. The Willamette River is known for flooding because
        of the high amounts and variations of precipitation in the valley. The largest
        flood on the Willamette River, in recorded history, occurred in 1861 when
        rainstorms and warm temperatures combined with a well-above-average snowpack
        in the Cascades. From Eugene to Portland, thousands of acres of riverside

        assist with water management for the basin:\n- GeoHMS (Geospatial Hydrologic
        Modeling Extension)\n- ResSIM (Reservoir System Simulation)\n- RAS (River
        Analysis System)\n- FIA (Flood Impact Analysis)\n\nThe Willamette River, a
        major tributary of the Columbia River, is 187 miles long. Flowing northward
        between the Oregon Coast Range and Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries
        form a basin called the Willamette Valley. The valley, fed by rainfall on
        the western side of the Cascades, is one of the most fertile agriculture regions
        of the United States.\nThe main stem of the Willamette River is formed by
        the confluence of the Middle and Coast Forks of the Willamette River near
        Springfield, Oregon. The main stem flows north for 187 miles to the Columbia
        River. Significant tributaries of the Willamette River, from source to mouth,
        include the Middle and Coast Fork Willamette, the McKenzie, Long Tom, Marys,
        Calapooia, Santiam, Luckiamute, Yamhill, Molalla, Tualatin, and Clackamas
        rivers. The main stem of the Willamette River has an elevation of 438 feet
        at its headwaters and loses 428 feet in elevation between source and mouth
        or about 2.3 feet per mile. The gradient is slightly steeper from the source
        to Albany than from Albany to Oregon City. The main stem of the Willamette
        varies in width from about 330 to 660 feet. The average flow at the mouth
        is approximately 32,400 cubic feet per second and contributes 12 to 15 percent
        of the total flow of the Columbia River. The Willamette’s flow varies seasonally,
        averaging about 8,200 cfs in August to more than 79,000 cfs in December.\nThe
        Willamette River basin contains thirteen USACE dams. The primary purpose of
        these projects is to prevent flood damages to the downstream metropolitan
        areas of the Willamette Valley but other purposes include hydropower generation,
        fish and wildlife, water quality, recreational use and water supply. The regulation
        of flood and conservation storage in each reservoir is coordinated with the
        regulation of storage in all of the other reservoirs in the basin.\nCommunities
        along the main stem at risk of flooding include Springfield and Eugene in
        Lane County; Harrisburg in Linn County; Corvallis in Benton County; Albany
        in Linn and Benton Counties; Salem in Marion County; Newberg in Yamhill County;
        Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, and Lake Oswego in Clackamas County, and
        Portland in Multnomah and Washington counties. The Willamette River is known
        for flooding because of the high amounts and variations of precipitation in
        the valley. The largest flood on the Willamette River, in recorded history,
        occurred in 1861 when rainstorms and warm temperatures combined with a well-above-average
        snowpack in the Cascades. From Eugene to Portland, thousands of acres of riverside
        farmland were washed away and many towns in the valley were damaged or destroyed.
        Peaking at 635,000 cubic feet per second, the 1861 flood inundated approximately
        353,000 acres of land. Although the Willamette River is regulated and controlled
        by a complex system of dams, severe flooding is still a concern. In 1996,
        a low elevation snowpack combined with massive rainfall and warm temperatures,
        caused some of the costliest floods to ever affect the Willamette Valley.","contributor":null,"subject":["Corps

        Extension)\n- ResSIM (Reservoir System Simulation)\n- RAS (River Analysis
        System)\n- FIA (Flood Impact Analysis)\n\nThe West Branch Susquehanna River
        Watershed covers almost 7000 square miles in central and north-central Pennsylvania.
        The upper or western part of the watershed lies mainly in the Appalachian
        Plateau Physiographic Province and is generally characterized by narrow flat-bottomed
        valleys with steep walls rising to rolling plateaus. Low mountains typically
        range up to 2500 feet in elevation. Most of the area is forested, with numerous
        state parks, state forests, and state game lands. Stream gradients along the
        main stem West Branch Susquehanna River in this portion of the watershed average
        about 6 feet per mile. Some tributary streams, however, have gradients that
        exceed 15 to 20 feet per mile, contributing to quick increases in runoff during
        intense storms or rapid snowmelt events. The eastern part of the watershed
        lies mainly in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province. Stream gradients
        along the main stem West Branch Susquehanna River in this lower portion of
        the watershed flatten out and average about 2 feet per mile. Valley portions
        are devoted mainly to agriculture.\nIn addition to the West Branch Susquehanna
        River, major tributary streams in the watershed include Clearfield Creek,
        Moshannon Creek, Bald Eagle Creek, Sinnemahoning Creek, Kettle Creek, Pine
        Creek, Lycoming Creek, Loyalsock Creek and Muncy Creek. There are only two
        major population centers in the watershed. Williamsport has a population of
        almost 30,000 and Lock Haven has a population of almost 10,000; both cities
        are located on the banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River. Most other
        towns in the watershed have populations less than 5,000 people, with many
        being located adjacent to tributary streams and the main stem West Branch
        Susquehanna River.\nThe four reservoir projects in the watershed are regulated
        as a system for flood risk management along the West Branch Susquehanna River.
        Taken together, these four projects have generated over $860 million in flood
        damage reduction benefits over the past 50 years. Each reservoir also provides
        water-oriented recreational features such as beaches, boat launches, fishing
        facilities, camping areas, and picnic zones that are managed by state and
        local sponsors. Portions of the West Branch Susquehanna watershed are degraded
        by acid mine drainage from abandoned coal mines, and the Curwensville and
        Sayers projects are occasionally regulated to mitigate the adverse effects
        of acid mine drainage along the West Branch Susquehanna River. In addition,
        Curwensville Lake provides 5240 acre-feet of dedicated water supply storage
        for downstream consumptive use make-up. \nMayss Saadoon   U.S. Army corps

        River. Most other towns in the watershed have populations less than 5,000
        people, with many being located adjacent to tributary streams and the main
        stem West Branch Susquehanna River.\nThe four reservoir projects in the watershed
        are regulated as a system for flood risk management along the West Branch
        Susquehanna River. Taken together, these four projects have generated over
        $860 million in flood damage reduction benefits over the past 50 years. Each
        reservoir also provides water-oriented recreational features such as beaches,
        boat launches, fishing facilities, camping areas, and picnic zones that are
        managed by state and local sponsors. Portions of the West Branch Susquehanna
        watershed are degraded by acid mine drainage from abandoned coal mines, and
        the Curwensville and Sayers projects are occasionally regulated to mitigate
        the adverse effects of acid mine drainage along the West Branch Susquehanna
        River. In addition, Curwensville Lake provides 5240 acre-feet of dedicated
        water supply storage for downstream consumptive use make-up.","contributor":null,"subject":["West
