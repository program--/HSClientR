        Total suspended solids (TSS) and Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) from White
        Clay Creek near the Stroud Water Research Center, Avondale, PA, USA. The purpose
        is to quantify export of inorganic and organic particulate matter from the
        725-hectare watershed. Samples consist of those taken at monthly intervals,
        normally the first Wednesday of each month regardless of weather or flow conditions
        and those taken after precipitation events. The monthly samples are manual
        grab samples collected in 5-L polyethylene “space saver” bottles from a few
        centimeters below the surface and without disturbance to the stream bed. The
        event samples were collected in response to precipitation of 20 mm or more
        using an ISCO automated sampler which collected 1-L samples s in polyethylene
        bottles at hourly intervals through an intake approximately 20 cm above the
        bed. Each of approximately four events per year are represented by approximately
        10 samples selected from the hourly series to characterize the rise, peak,
        and falling limb of the hydrograph. Additional events are represented by the
        three samples nearest peak flow. \nAufdenkampe, A.K.    Newbold, J.D.    Anderson,

        -- Stream Water Chemistry, Stream Ecology -- USGS -- Chester County, PA --
        (1998-2013) \n CompositeResource Since 1969, the U.S. Geological Survey and
        the Chester County Water Resources Authority have conducted a cooperative
        program to evaluate stream ecology and water-quality conditions using benthic
        macroinvertebrates and stream-water chemistry. The Stream Conditions of Chester
        County Program has sampled streams every fall for over 30 years. The initial
        goals of the program were to evaluate stream-water quality and to further
        the understanding of changes in the stream ecosystem in response to urbanization.
        The current goals of the program are to use the data to monitor current conditions
        and determine trends. Data from the program have been used to help support
        Chester County Landscapes by providing information on biological diversity
        and water-quality conditions. Without monitoring it is impossible to determine
        if changes in land use or environmental policies and regulation are having
        a positive affect on water quality.\n\n\n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are
        macroscopic animals that inhabit the bottoms of aquatic habitats. Freshwater
        forms include aquatic insects and other invertebrates including clams, crustaceans,
        snails, and worms. Factors such as streamflow, food availability, habitat,
        temperature, and water quality determine the makeup of the macroinvertebrate
        community. By sampling in similar habitats with similar physical conditions,
        water quality becomes the determining factor controlling community structure.
        Changes in abundance, diversity, species richness, and presence or absence
        of pollution tolerant or intolerant species can be measured and related to
        water quality. Trends in water quality can be determined by sampling at a
        single location over several years and observing changes to the community
        structure. \n\n\n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are well suited as water-quality
        indicators because of their biology and availability. They are present in
        most aquatic systems and are relatively easy to collect. They are indicators
        of overall water quality and can be used to identify specific types and sources
        of degraded water quality. Benthic macroinvertebrates have limited mobility
        and cannot avoid poor water-quality conditions. They are sensitive to a wide
        range of environmental impacts including chemical and physical impairments.
        \n\n\n\nBiological samples collected for the Stream Conditions of Chester
        County Biological Monitoring Network consist of benthic macroinvertebrates
        collected from a riffle area of the stream. A riffle habitat is used because
        macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance is usually highest there. \n\n\n\nSee

        comments Sample collection and identification methods remained consistent
        from 1970 through 1997. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected by taking
        10 rocks (45-90 millimeters in diameter) at random. Water-quality conditions
        were determined by analysis of the community structure and calculation of
        Brillouin&#39;s Diversity Index. In this index, diversity is high if a community
        contains many organisms that are evenly distributed; diversity is low if there
        are few organisms that are unevenly distributed. Brillouin&#39;s diversity
        index values greater than 3.0 are associated with waters receiving little
        or no organic wastes. Values between 1.0 and 3.0 are associated with waters
        receiving moderate organic wastes, and values below 1.0 are associated with
        waters receiving heavy organic wastes. \n\n \n\nA new sampling protocol for
        the Stream Conditions of Chester County Biological Monitoring Network was
        established in 1998 to update the program and meet the county&#39;s current
        needs. The new sampling protocols are based on Rapid Bioassessment Protocols
        (RBP) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Samples are
        collected from areas of various velocities from within a riffle. Water-quality
        conditions are determined by analysis of the community structure and calculation
        of various metrics including total individuals, taxa richness, Brillouin&#39;s
        Diversity Index, Hilsonhoff Biotic Index, EPT taxa richness, percent EPT taxa,
        and percent dominate taxa. This sampling method will allow the county to compare
        results with those from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,
        universities, local watershed associations, and other federal agencies that
        are using RBP&#39;s.  \n\n \n\nSampling locations were adjusted in 1998 to
        relocate the sampling sites to better meet the county&#39;s needs. Twenty-seven
        sites are samples each year. Eighteen sites are fixed integrator or reference
        sites. These fixed integrator sites are sampled every year. Nine sites are
        selected each year to assess the water quality in areas of interest to the
        county. The realignment of sampling sites provides better spatial coverage
        while increasing flexibility. The increased flexibility allows for the placement
        of sites to study the effects on water-quality of specific events such as
        road construction or residential and business developments. This makes the
        program capable of both short-term and long-term evaluation of stream-water
        quality. \n\n \n\nThe Stream Conditions of Chester County Program has determined
        that the quality of Chester County streams has greatly improved since 1970.
        Current benthic macroinvertebrate communities are more diverse and contain
        more pollution sensitive species compared to communities sampled at the beginning
        of the program. Forty-five of forty-six sites analyzed between 1970 and 1986
        had a statistically significant increase in diversity. keywords macroinvertebrate

        The U.S. Geological Survey maintains 15 stations to measure the flow of Chester
        County streams. Streams are a critical component of our environment and economic
        infrastructure. They are critical to water availability for domestic, agricultural,
        and industrial use. They are the source of floods, which are among the Nation&#39;s
        most severe natural disasters, both in loss of life and in economic damage.
        They provide the habitat, spawning grounds, and avenues of movement for fish.
        Streams are a source of great recreational activity in terms of boating, fishing,
        and simple enjoyment of visiting and viewing the stream and its environs.

        Advancements in cyberinfrastructure (CI) to support cloud-based tools and
        services for the water science community have changed how researchers conduct,
        share, and publish scientific workflows. These have had a transformative impact
        on how our community addresses the challenges associated with interdisciplinary
        collaboration, reproducing scientific findings, and developing real-world
        educational modules. The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of
        Hydrologic Science, Inc (CUAHSI) facilitates discussion around these topics,
        with the water science community, to better identify the shortcomings of current
        CI approaches and define the requirements for the next generation of cloud
        services. The purpose of this workshop is to introduce and solicit feedback
        on the current suite of CUAHSI community to computational tools to that have
        been designed to improve the way water science research and education is conducted
        in the cloud. This workshop will consist of several technologies that are
        actively being developed for working with data Earth surface data. Our goal
        is to demonstrate how these compute environments can be used in educational
        applications, workshops, reproducing published work, and conducting research.
        Participants will be presented with several approaches for working with their
        data within the CUAHSI ecosystem of tools. The workshop will focus heavily
        on interactive examples and will feature several programming languages including
        Python, R, and MATLAB. Participants are not required to be proficient in these
        languages but should bring a laptop computer, be ready to work through live
        examples, and willing to provide constructive feedback. \nCastronova, Anthony

        tendency to use Python and R in the analytics world for physical/statistical
        modeling and data visualization. As scientists, analysts, or statisticians,
        we oftentimes choose the tool that allows us to perform the task in the quickest

        means R. For many, that means a combination of the two. However, it may take
        considerable time to switch between these two languages, passing data and
        models through .csv files or database systems. There&#39;s a solution that
        allows researchers to quickly and easily interface R and Python together in

        Data for Mapping Permeable Media Architecture and Interstitial Flow \nConsortium

        Porous media are ubiquitous, a key component of the water cycle and locus
        of many biogeochemical transformations. Mapping media architecture and interstitial
        flows have been challenging because of the inherent difficulty of seeing through
        solids. Previous works used particle image velocimetry (PIV) coupled with
        refractive index-matching (RIM) to quantify interstitial flows, but they were
        limited to specialized and often toxic fluids that precluded investigating
        biological processes. To address this limitation, we present a low-cost and
        scalable method based on RIM coupled PIV (RIM-PIV) and planar laser induced
        fluorescence (RIM-PLIF) to simultaneously map both media architecture and
        interstitial velocities. Here, we store and report the data used in &quot;A

        that were used for the study described in the abstract below.\nHurricane Harvey
        produced unprecedented flooding that altered flood frequency statistics near
        Houston. While Harvey could have made landfall elsewhere along the Gulf coast,
        traditional flood frequency methodologies only consider the risk of Harvey
        in the region that it hit. This may be a significant shortcoming of flood
        frequency methodologies as the intensity of Harvey was greater due to climate
        change; therefore, Harvey may be more indicative of future hurricanes than
        other historical observations. This study addresses this shortcoming by investigating
        what effect Harvey would have had on flood frequency statistics if it had
        made landfall elsewhere. This was done by shifting spatial rainfall data to
        probable alternative landfall locations in two separate geomorphologic regions
        adjacent to the Texas coast and using synthetic unit hydrographs to create
        a simulated set of peakflows. These simulated peakflows were then used to
        evaluate the impact of Harvey in these new locations using Log Pearson III
        and Regional Flood Frequency Analyses. Log Pearson III analyses with simulated
        Harvey streamflows produced 100-year peakflows that were, on average, 21.4%
        – 63.9% higher than analyses that only used historical records. A similar
        Regional Flood Frequency analysis in the central coastal geomorphologic region
        of Texas showed that predictive equations, based upon basin area and shape
        factor, had an average increase of 17.7% in the 100-year peak discharge. This
        study demonstrates that contemporary storms, whose intensities are increased
        by climate change, may have similar impacts on flood frequency statistics

        inundation remains challenging to map, model, and forecast because it requires
        detailed representations of hydrologic and hydraulic processes. Recently,
        Continental‐Scale Flood Inundation Mapping (CFIM), an empirical approach with
        fewer data demands, has been suggested. This approach uses National Water
        Model forecast discharge with Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) calculated
        from a digital elevation model to approximate reach‐averaged hydraulic properties,
        estimate a synthetic rating curve, and map near real‐time flood inundation
        from stage. In 2017, rapid snowmelt resulted in a record flood on the Bear
        River in Utah, USA. In this study, we evaluated the CFIM method over the river
        section where this flooding occurred. We compared modeled flood inundation
        with the flood inundation observed in high‐resolution Planet RapidEye satellite
        imagery. Differences were attributed to discrepancies between observed and
        forecast discharges but also notably due to shortcomings in the derivation
        of HAND from National Elevation Dataset as implemented in CFIM, and possibly
        due to sub optimal hydraulic roughness parameter. Examining these differences
        highlights limitations in the HAND terrain analysis methodology. We present
        a set of improvements developed to overcome some limitations and advance CFIM
        outcomes. These include conditioning the topography using high‐resolution
        hydrography, dispersing nodes used to subdivide the river into reaches and
        catchments, and using a high‐resolution digital elevation model. We also suggest
        an approach to obtain a reach specific Manning&#39;s n from observed inundation
        and validated improvements for the flood of March 2019 in the Ocheyedan River,
        Iowa. The methods developed have the potential to improve CFIM.\n\nThe file

        exchange from channel-spanning logjams, Journal of Hydrology, https://doi.org/10.​1016/​j.​jhydrol.​2020.​124931.\n\nHuman
        impacts such as timber harvesting, channel engineering, beaver removal, and
        urbanization alter the physical and chemical characteristics of streams. These
        anthropogenic changes have reduced fallen trees and loose wood that form blockages
        in streams. Logjams increase hydraulic resistance and create hydraulic head
        gradients along the streambed that drive groundwater-surface water exchange.
        Here, we quantify changes in hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) due to a channel-spanning
        logjam using field measurements and numerical modeling in MODFLOW and MT3DMS.
        Electrical resistivity (ER) imaging was used to monitor the transport of solutes
        into the hyporheic zone during a series of in-stream tracer tests supplemented
        by in-stream monitoring. We conducted experiments in two reaches in Little
        Beaver Creek, Colorado (USA): one with a single, channel-spanning logjam and
        the second at a control reach with no logjams. Our results show that 1) higher
        HEF occurred at the reach with a logjam, 2) logjams create complex HEF pathways
        that can cause bimodal solute breakthrough behavior downstream, and 3) higher
        discharge rates associated with spring snowmelt increase the extent and magnitude
        of HEF. The numerical modeling supports all three field findings, and also
        suggest that lower flows increase solute retention in streams, although this
        last conclusion is not supported by field results. This study represents the
        first use of ER to explore HEF around a naturally occurring logjam over different
        stream discharges and has implications for understanding how logjams influence
        the transport of solutes, the health of stream ecosystems, and stream restoration

        as timber harvesting, channel engineering, beaver removal, and urbanization
        alter the physical and chemical characteristics of streams. These anthropogenic
        changes have reduced fallen trees and loose wood that form blockages in streams.
        Logjams increase hydraulic resistance and create hydraulic head gradients
        along the streambed that drive groundwater-surface water exchange. Here, we
        quantify changes in hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) due to a channel-spanning
        logjam using field measurements and numerical modeling in MODFLOW and MT3DMS.
        Electrical resistivity (ER) imaging was used to monitor the transport of solutes
        into the hyporheic zone during a series of in-stream tracer tests supplemented
        by in-stream monitoring. We conducted experiments in two reaches in Little
        Beaver Creek, Colorado (USA): one with a single, channel-spanning logjam and
        the second at a control reach with no logjams. Our results show that 1) higher
        HEF occurred at the reach with a logjam, 2) logjams create complex HEF pathways
        that can cause bimodal solute breakthrough behavior downstream, and 3) higher
        discharge rates associated with spring snowmelt increase the extent and magnitude
        of HEF. The numerical modeling supports all three field findings, and also
        suggest that lower flows increase solute retention in streams, although this
        last conclusion is not supported by field results. This study represents the
        first use of ER to explore HEF around a naturally occurring logjam over different
        stream discharges and has implications for understanding how logjams influence
        the transport of solutes, the health of stream ecosystems, and stream restoration
        and conservation efforts.","contributor":["Wohl, Ellen","Sawyer, Audrey"],"subject":["transducer","hyporheic

        so compared with the northern tributary. The geographical focus of the research
        report is the southern catchment of the Ruebisbaach. In the results of the
        research the southern catchment will be compared with the northern catchment.
        The results includes measured data during the research proces. These data
        is originated from various discharge and infiltration methods. All the collected
        discharge and infiltration data were processed in excel formats and analyzed
        in a systematic way. To find the right data the excel name is described as

        search methods provide a heuristic mapping between observations and decisions
        and have been widely used in reservoir control studies. However, recent studies
        have observed a tendency for policy search methods to overfit to the hydrologic

        This technical note develops an extension of bootstrap aggregation (bagging)
        and cross-validation techniques, inspired by the machine learning literature,
        to improve control policy performance on out-of-sample hydrology. We explore
        these methods using a case study of Folsom Reservoir, California using control
        policies structured as binary trees and daily streamflow resampling based
        on the paleo-inflow record. Results show that calibration-validation strategies
        for policy selection and certain ensemble aggregation methods can improve
        out-of-sample tradeoffs between water supply and flood risk objectives over
        baseline performance given fixed computational costs. These results highlight

        in medium-range forecasts of heavy precipitation in the Sacramento River basin:
        Implications for water management &#39; \n CompositeResource Forecasts of
        heavy precipitation delivered by atmospheric rivers (ARs) are becoming increasingly
        important for both flood control and water supply management in reservoirs
        across California. This study examines the hypothesis that medium-range forecasts
        of heavy precipitation at the basin scale exhibit recurrent spatial biases
        that are driven by mesoscale and synoptic scale features of associated AR
        events. This hypothesis is tested for heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento
        River basin using 36 years of NCEP medium-range reforecasts from 1984 to 2019.
        For each event we cluster precipitation forecast error across western North
        America for lead times ranging from 1 to 15 days. Integrated vapor transport
        (IVT), 500 hPa geopotential heights, and landfall characteristics of ARs are
        composited across clusters and lead times to diagnose the causes of precipitation
        forecast biases. We investigate the temporal evolution of forecast error to
        characterize its persistence across lead times, and explore the accuracy of
        forecasted IVT anomalies across different domains of the North American west
        coast during heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento basin. Our results
        identify recurrent spatial patterns of precipitation forecast error consistent
        with errors of forecasted synoptic scale features, especially at long (5-15
        day) leads. Moreover, we find evidence that forecasts of AR landfalls well
        outside of the latitudinal bounds of the Sacramento basin precede heavy precipitation
        events within the basin. These results suggest the potential for using medium-range
        forecasts of large-scale climate features across the Pacific-North American
        sector, rather than just local forecasts of basin-scale precipitation, when
        designing forecast-informed reservoir operations. \nBrodeur, Zachary Paul   Cornell

        Inc. (CUAHSI) CompositeResource The Resazurin (Raz) – Resorufin (Rru) tracer
        system is widely used in hydrological studies. In most field experiments a
        lack of mass balance closure is reported and, to date, it is still unclear
        what drives incomplete recovery. We designed controlled laboratory experiments
        varying the initial concentrations of Raz, the test durations, and the type
        of microorganisms present to quantify mass balances of Raz and Rru in the
        absence of other suspected causes of incomplete recovery in field experiments

        -- Rainfall Chemistry, Stream Water Chemistry, Throughfall Chemistry, Groundwater
        Chemistry -- Solute chemistry -- Rivendell -- (2007-2015) \n CompositeResource
        Significant solute flux from the weathered bedrock zone - which underlies
        soils and saprolite - has been suggested by many studies. However, controlling
        processes for the hydrochemistry dynamics in this zone are poorly understood.
        This work reports the first results from a four-year (2009-2012) high-frequency
        (1-3 day) monitoring of major solutes (Ca, Mg, Na, K and Si) in the perched,
        dynamic groundwater in a 4000 m2 zero-order basin located at the Angelo Coast
        Range Reserve, Northern California. Groundwater samples were autonomously
        collected at three wells (downslope, mid-slope, and upslope) aligned with
        the axis of the drainage. Rain and throughfall samples, profiles of well headspace
        pCO2, vertical profiles and time series of groundwater temperature, and contemporaneous
        data from an extensive hydrologic and climate sensor network provided the
        framework for data analysis. \n\n\n\nAll runoff at this soil-mantled site
        occurs by vertical unsaturated flow through a 5-25 m thick weathered argillite
        and then by lateral flows to the adjacent channel as groundwater perched over
        fresher bedrock. Driven by strongly seasonal rainfall, over each of the four
        years of observations, the hydrochemistry of the groundwater at each well
        repeats an annual cycle, which can be explained by two end-member processes.
        The first end-member process, which dominates during the winter high-flow
        season in mid- and upslope areas, is CO2 enhanced cation exchange reaction
        in the vadose zone in the more shallow conductive weathered bedrock. This
        process rapidly increases the cation concentrations of the infiltrated rainwater,
        which is responsible for the lowest cation concentration of groundwater. The
        second-end member process occurs in the deeper perched groundwater and either
        dominates year-round (at the downslope well) or becomes progressively dominant
        during low flow season at the two upper slope wells. This process is the equilibrium
        reaction with minerals such as calcite and clay minerals, but not with primary
        minerals, suggesting the critical role of the residence time of the water.
        Collectively, our measurements reveal that the hydrochemistry dynamics of
        the groundwater in the weathered bedrock zone is governed by two end-member
        processes whose dominance varies with critical zone structure, the relative
        importance of vadose versus groundwater zone processes, and thus with the
        seasonal variation of the chemistry of recharge and runoff. \nKim, Hyojin    Bishop,

        County, California. Most of the sampling was done within Rivendell. Rivendell
        is the intensive study site of the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory (http://criticalzone.org/eel).
        Rivendell is divided into 5 levels that correspond roughly with contours starting
        at creek level (level 1) and going to ridge-top (level 5). Sampling dates
        range from 2008 to 2014. The datasets are associated with the dissertation
        of Jasper Oshun, 2016 in Earth & Planetary Sciences, UC Berkeley.\n\n","contributor":null,"subject":["deuterium","stable

        The European Union Water JPI (http://www.waterjpi.eu/) has funded the project
        PROGNOS (Predicting In-Lake Responses to Change Using Near Real Time Models  http://prognoswater.org/).  PROGNOS
        developed an integrated approach that couples high frequency (HF) lake monitoring
        data to dynamic lake water quality models to forecast short-term changes in
        lake water quality. Here we provide an archive that demonstrates model simulations
        that were run on Lake Erken as part of the PROGNOS project. Simulations were
        run using the GOTM (https://gotm.net/)and SELMA models that are coupled by
        the frame work for biogeochemical models (https://github.com/fabm-model).
        The lake model was calibrated using the program acpy (https://bolding-bruggeman.com/portfolio/acpy/)
        The measured data used for calibration in the format used by acpy are also
        included in this archive\n\nAll data were collected from Lake Erken the site
        of the Uppsala University Limnology field station (http://www.ieg.uu.se/erken-laboratory/).
        The simulation period is between 2004-2018, and we used a 5 year (1999-2003)
        model spin-up period prior to simulation and calibration.  Model forcing data
        are obtained from meteorological stations at the Erken laboratory, and from
        Erken&#39;s routine monitoring program.  To calibrate the model data sets
        of HF water temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence and dissolved oxygen are
        combined with laboratory measurement from the routine monitoring program.  Calibration

        of hydrologic controls on forest growth \nConsortium of Universities for the
        Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) CompositeResource Vegetation
        provides key ecosystem services and is an important component in the hydrological
        cycle. Traditionally, the global distribution of vegetation is explained through
        climatic water availability. Locally, however, groundwater can aid growth
        by providing an extra water source (e.g. oases) or hinder growth by presenting
        a barrier to root expansion (e.g. swamps). In this study we analyse the global
        correlation between humidity (expressing climate driven water- and energy
        availability), groundwater and forest growth, approximated by the fraction
        of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and link this to climate
        and landscape position. The results show that at the continental scale, climate
        is the main driver of forest productivity; climates with higher water availability
        support higher energy absorption and consequentially more growth. Within all
        climate zones, however, landscape position substantially alters the growth
        patterns, both positively and negatively. The influence of the landscape on
        vegetation growth varies over climate, displaying the importance of analysing
        vegetation growth in a climate-landscape continuum. \nRoebroek, Caspar Tobias

        and is an important component in the hydrological cycle. Traditionally, the
        global distribution of vegetation is explained through climatic water availability.
        Locally, however, groundwater can aid growth by providing an extra water source
        (e.g. oases) or hinder growth by presenting a barrier to root expansion (e.g.
        swamps). In this study we analyse the global correlation between humidity
        (expressing climate driven water- and energy availability), groundwater and
        forest growth, approximated by the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically
        active radiation, and link this to climate and landscape position. The results
        show that at the continental scale, climate is the main driver of forest productivity;
        climates with higher water availability support higher energy absorption and
        consequentially more growth. Within all climate zones, however, landscape
        position substantially alters the growth patterns, both positively and negatively.
        The influence of the landscape on vegetation growth varies over climate, displaying
        the importance of analysing vegetation growth in a climate-landscape continuum.","contributor":null,"subject":["Climate","Hydrology","Tree

        Total suspended solids (TSS) and Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) from White
        Clay Creek near the Stroud Water Research Center, Avondale, PA, USA. The purpose
        is to quantify export of inorganic and organic particulate matter from the
        725-hectare watershed. Samples consist of those taken at monthly intervals,
        normally the first Wednesday of each month regardless of weather or flow conditions
        and those taken after precipitation events. The monthly samples are manual
        grab samples collected in 5-L polyethylene “space saver” bottles from a few
        centimeters below the surface and without disturbance to the stream bed. The
        event samples were collected in response to precipitation of 20 mm or more
        using an ISCO automated sampler which collected 1-L samples s in polyethylene
        bottles at hourly intervals through an intake approximately 20 cm above the
        bed. Each of approximately four events per year are represented by approximately
        10 samples selected from the hourly series to characterize the rise, peak,
        and falling limb of the hydrograph. Additional events are represented by the
        three samples nearest peak flow. \nAufdenkampe, A.K.    Newbold, J.D.    Anderson,

        -- Stream Water Chemistry, Stream Ecology -- USGS -- Chester County, PA --
        (1998-2013) \n CompositeResource Since 1969, the U.S. Geological Survey and
        the Chester County Water Resources Authority have conducted a cooperative
        program to evaluate stream ecology and water-quality conditions using benthic
        macroinvertebrates and stream-water chemistry. The Stream Conditions of Chester
        County Program has sampled streams every fall for over 30 years. The initial
        goals of the program were to evaluate stream-water quality and to further
        the understanding of changes in the stream ecosystem in response to urbanization.
        The current goals of the program are to use the data to monitor current conditions
        and determine trends. Data from the program have been used to help support
        Chester County Landscapes by providing information on biological diversity
        and water-quality conditions. Without monitoring it is impossible to determine
        if changes in land use or environmental policies and regulation are having
        a positive affect on water quality.\n\n\n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are
        macroscopic animals that inhabit the bottoms of aquatic habitats. Freshwater
        forms include aquatic insects and other invertebrates including clams, crustaceans,
        snails, and worms. Factors such as streamflow, food availability, habitat,
        temperature, and water quality determine the makeup of the macroinvertebrate
        community. By sampling in similar habitats with similar physical conditions,
        water quality becomes the determining factor controlling community structure.
        Changes in abundance, diversity, species richness, and presence or absence
        of pollution tolerant or intolerant species can be measured and related to
        water quality. Trends in water quality can be determined by sampling at a
        single location over several years and observing changes to the community
        structure. \n\n\n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are well suited as water-quality
        indicators because of their biology and availability. They are present in
        most aquatic systems and are relatively easy to collect. They are indicators
        of overall water quality and can be used to identify specific types and sources
        of degraded water quality. Benthic macroinvertebrates have limited mobility
        and cannot avoid poor water-quality conditions. They are sensitive to a wide
        range of environmental impacts including chemical and physical impairments.
        \n\n\n\nBiological samples collected for the Stream Conditions of Chester
        County Biological Monitoring Network consist of benthic macroinvertebrates
        collected from a riffle area of the stream. A riffle habitat is used because
        macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance is usually highest there. \n\n\n\nSee

        comments Sample collection and identification methods remained consistent
        from 1970 through 1997. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected by taking
        10 rocks (45-90 millimeters in diameter) at random. Water-quality conditions
        were determined by analysis of the community structure and calculation of
        Brillouin&#39;s Diversity Index. In this index, diversity is high if a community
        contains many organisms that are evenly distributed; diversity is low if there
        are few organisms that are unevenly distributed. Brillouin&#39;s diversity
        index values greater than 3.0 are associated with waters receiving little
        or no organic wastes. Values between 1.0 and 3.0 are associated with waters
        receiving moderate organic wastes, and values below 1.0 are associated with
        waters receiving heavy organic wastes. \n\n \n\nA new sampling protocol for
        the Stream Conditions of Chester County Biological Monitoring Network was
        established in 1998 to update the program and meet the county&#39;s current
        needs. The new sampling protocols are based on Rapid Bioassessment Protocols
        (RBP) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Samples are
        collected from areas of various velocities from within a riffle. Water-quality
        conditions are determined by analysis of the community structure and calculation
        of various metrics including total individuals, taxa richness, Brillouin&#39;s
        Diversity Index, Hilsonhoff Biotic Index, EPT taxa richness, percent EPT taxa,
        and percent dominate taxa. This sampling method will allow the county to compare
        results with those from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,
        universities, local watershed associations, and other federal agencies that
        are using RBP&#39;s.  \n\n \n\nSampling locations were adjusted in 1998 to
        relocate the sampling sites to better meet the county&#39;s needs. Twenty-seven
        sites are samples each year. Eighteen sites are fixed integrator or reference
        sites. These fixed integrator sites are sampled every year. Nine sites are
        selected each year to assess the water quality in areas of interest to the
        county. The realignment of sampling sites provides better spatial coverage
        while increasing flexibility. The increased flexibility allows for the placement
        of sites to study the effects on water-quality of specific events such as
        road construction or residential and business developments. This makes the
        program capable of both short-term and long-term evaluation of stream-water
        quality. \n\n \n\nThe Stream Conditions of Chester County Program has determined
        that the quality of Chester County streams has greatly improved since 1970.
        Current benthic macroinvertebrate communities are more diverse and contain
        more pollution sensitive species compared to communities sampled at the beginning
        of the program. Forty-five of forty-six sites analyzed between 1970 and 1986
        had a statistically significant increase in diversity. keywords macroinvertebrate

        The U.S. Geological Survey maintains 15 stations to measure the flow of Chester
        County streams. Streams are a critical component of our environment and economic
        infrastructure. They are critical to water availability for domestic, agricultural,
        and industrial use. They are the source of floods, which are among the Nation&#39;s
        most severe natural disasters, both in loss of life and in economic damage.
        They provide the habitat, spawning grounds, and avenues of movement for fish.
        Streams are a source of great recreational activity in terms of boating, fishing,
        and simple enjoyment of visiting and viewing the stream and its environs.

        Advancements in cyberinfrastructure (CI) to support cloud-based tools and
        services for the water science community have changed how researchers conduct,
        share, and publish scientific workflows. These have had a transformative impact
        on how our community addresses the challenges associated with interdisciplinary
        collaboration, reproducing scientific findings, and developing real-world
        educational modules. The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of
        Hydrologic Science, Inc (CUAHSI) facilitates discussion around these topics,
        with the water science community, to better identify the shortcomings of current
        CI approaches and define the requirements for the next generation of cloud
        services. The purpose of this workshop is to introduce and solicit feedback
        on the current suite of CUAHSI community to computational tools to that have
        been designed to improve the way water science research and education is conducted
        in the cloud. This workshop will consist of several technologies that are
        actively being developed for working with data Earth surface data. Our goal
        is to demonstrate how these compute environments can be used in educational
        applications, workshops, reproducing published work, and conducting research.
        Participants will be presented with several approaches for working with their
        data within the CUAHSI ecosystem of tools. The workshop will focus heavily
        on interactive examples and will feature several programming languages including
        Python, R, and MATLAB. Participants are not required to be proficient in these
        languages but should bring a laptop computer, be ready to work through live

        Data for Mapping Permeable Media Architecture and Interstitial Flow \nConsortium

        Porous media are ubiquitous, a key component of the water cycle and locus
        of many biogeochemical transformations. Mapping media architecture and interstitial
        flows have been challenging because of the inherent difficulty of seeing through
        solids. Previous works used particle image velocimetry (PIV) coupled with
        refractive index-matching (RIM) to quantify interstitial flows, but they were
        limited to specialized and often toxic fluids that precluded investigating
        biological processes. To address this limitation, we present a low-cost and
        scalable method based on RIM coupled PIV (RIM-PIV) and planar laser induced
        fluorescence (RIM-PLIF) to simultaneously map both media architecture and
        interstitial velocities. Here, we store and report the data used in &quot;A

        &quot; \n CompositeResource The following resource contains the data and code
        that were used for the study described in the abstract below.\nHurricane Harvey
        produced unprecedented flooding that altered flood frequency statistics near
        Houston. While Harvey could have made landfall elsewhere along the Gulf coast,
        traditional flood frequency methodologies only consider the risk of Harvey
        in the region that it hit. This may be a significant shortcoming of flood
        frequency methodologies as the intensity of Harvey was greater due to climate
        change; therefore, Harvey may be more indicative of future hurricanes than
        other historical observations. This study addresses this shortcoming by investigating
        what effect Harvey would have had on flood frequency statistics if it had
        made landfall elsewhere. This was done by shifting spatial rainfall data to
        probable alternative landfall locations in two separate geomorphologic regions
        adjacent to the Texas coast and using synthetic unit hydrographs to create
        a simulated set of peakflows. These simulated peakflows were then used to
        evaluate the impact of Harvey in these new locations using Log Pearson III
        and Regional Flood Frequency Analyses. Log Pearson III analyses with simulated
        Harvey streamflows produced 100-year peakflows that were, on average, 21.4%
        – 63.9% higher than analyses that only used historical records. A similar
        Regional Flood Frequency analysis in the central coastal geomorphologic region
        of Texas showed that predictive equations, based upon basin area and shape
        factor, had an average increase of 17.7% in the 100-year peak discharge. This
        study demonstrates that contemporary storms, whose intensities are increased
        by climate change, may have similar impacts on flood frequency statistics
        and regional regression equations in other regions within their probabilistic
        landfall path. \nRegier, Elizabeth   Marquette University McDonald, Walter   Marquette

        inundation remains challenging to map, model, and forecast because it requires
        detailed representations of hydrologic and hydraulic processes. Recently,
        Continental‐Scale Flood Inundation Mapping (CFIM), an empirical approach with
        fewer data demands, has been suggested. This approach uses National Water
        Model forecast discharge with Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) calculated
        from a digital elevation model to approximate reach‐averaged hydraulic properties,
        estimate a synthetic rating curve, and map near real‐time flood inundation
        from stage. In 2017, rapid snowmelt resulted in a record flood on the Bear
        River in Utah, USA. In this study, we evaluated the CFIM method over the river
        section where this flooding occurred. We compared modeled flood inundation
        with the flood inundation observed in high‐resolution Planet RapidEye satellite
        imagery. Differences were attributed to discrepancies between observed and
        forecast discharges but also notably due to shortcomings in the derivation
        of HAND from National Elevation Dataset as implemented in CFIM, and possibly
        due to sub optimal hydraulic roughness parameter. Examining these differences
        highlights limitations in the HAND terrain analysis methodology. We present
        a set of improvements developed to overcome some limitations and advance CFIM
        outcomes. These include conditioning the topography using high‐resolution
        hydrography, dispersing nodes used to subdivide the river into reaches and
        catchments, and using a high‐resolution digital elevation model. We also suggest
        an approach to obtain a reach specific Manning&#39;s n from observed inundation
        and validated improvements for the flood of March 2019 in the Ocheyedan River,

        in streams. Logjams increase hydraulic resistance and create hydraulic head
        gradients along the streambed that drive groundwater-surface water exchange.
        Here, we quantify changes in hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) due to a channel-spanning
        logjam using field measurements and numerical modeling in MODFLOW and MT3DMS.
        Electrical resistivity (ER) imaging was used to monitor the transport of solutes
        into the hyporheic zone during a series of in-stream tracer tests supplemented
        by in-stream monitoring. We conducted experiments in two reaches in Little
        Beaver Creek, Colorado (USA): one with a single, channel-spanning logjam and
        the second at a control reach with no logjams. Our results show that 1) higher
        HEF occurred at the reach with a logjam, 2) logjams create complex HEF pathways
        that can cause bimodal solute breakthrough behavior downstream, and 3) higher
        discharge rates associated with spring snowmelt increase the extent and magnitude
        of HEF. The numerical modeling supports all three field findings, and also
        suggest that lower flows increase solute retention in streams, although this
        last conclusion is not supported by field results. This study represents the
        first use of ER to explore HEF around a naturally occurring logjam over different
        stream discharges and has implications for understanding how logjams influence
        the transport of solutes, the health of stream ecosystems, and stream restoration

        The main objective of the research &#39;The source of the southern tributary
        of the Ruebisbaach&#39; is to figure out and understand what sources makes
        the southern tributary still flowing in a dry period and why it does so compared
        with the northern tributary. The geographical focus of the research report
        is the southern catchment of the Ruebisbaach. In the results of the research
        the southern catchment will be compared with the northern catchment. The results
        includes measured data during the research proces. These data is originated

        search methods provide a heuristic mapping between observations and decisions

        \n8780d5b2648c4c39acabc37bd6774cf8  Data Repository for &#39;Spatial bias
        in medium-range forecasts of heavy precipitation in the Sacramento River basin:
        Implications for water management &#39; \n CompositeResource Forecasts of
        heavy precipitation delivered by atmospheric rivers (ARs) are becoming increasingly
        important for both flood control and water supply management in reservoirs
        across California. This study examines the hypothesis that medium-range forecasts
        of heavy precipitation at the basin scale exhibit recurrent spatial biases
        that are driven by mesoscale and synoptic scale features of associated AR
        events. This hypothesis is tested for heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento
        River basin using 36 years of NCEP medium-range reforecasts from 1984 to 2019.
        For each event we cluster precipitation forecast error across western North
        America for lead times ranging from 1 to 15 days. Integrated vapor transport
        (IVT), 500 hPa geopotential heights, and landfall characteristics of ARs are
        composited across clusters and lead times to diagnose the causes of precipitation
        forecast biases. We investigate the temporal evolution of forecast error to
        characterize its persistence across lead times, and explore the accuracy of
        forecasted IVT anomalies across different domains of the North American west
        coast during heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento basin. Our results
        identify recurrent spatial patterns of precipitation forecast error consistent
        with errors of forecasted synoptic scale features, especially at long (5-15
        day) leads. Moreover, we find evidence that forecasts of AR landfalls well
        outside of the latitudinal bounds of the Sacramento basin precede heavy precipitation
        events within the basin. These results suggest the potential for using medium-range
        forecasts of large-scale climate features across the Pacific-North American
        sector, rather than just local forecasts of basin-scale precipitation, when
        designing forecast-informed reservoir operations. \nBrodeur, Zachary Paul   Cornell

        lack of mass balance closure is reported and, to date, it is still unclear

        absence of other suspected causes of incomplete recovery in field experiments
        (e.g., sorption to sediments and photodecay) in order to test if microbial
        activity alone could explain incomplete recovery. We used the summation of

        -- Rainfall Chemistry, Stream Water Chemistry, Throughfall Chemistry, Groundwater
        Chemistry -- Solute chemistry -- Rivendell -- (2007-2015) \n CompositeResource
        Significant solute flux from the weathered bedrock zone - which underlies
        soils and saprolite - has been suggested by many studies. However, controlling
        processes for the hydrochemistry dynamics in this zone are poorly understood.
        This work reports the first results from a four-year (2009-2012) high-frequency
        (1-3 day) monitoring of major solutes (Ca, Mg, Na, K and Si) in the perched,
        dynamic groundwater in a 4000 m2 zero-order basin located at the Angelo Coast
        Range Reserve, Northern California. Groundwater samples were autonomously
        collected at three wells (downslope, mid-slope, and upslope) aligned with
        the axis of the drainage. Rain and throughfall samples, profiles of well headspace
        pCO2, vertical profiles and time series of groundwater temperature, and contemporaneous
        data from an extensive hydrologic and climate sensor network provided the
        framework for data analysis. \n\n\n\nAll runoff at this soil-mantled site
        occurs by vertical unsaturated flow through a 5-25 m thick weathered argillite
        and then by lateral flows to the adjacent channel as groundwater perched over
        fresher bedrock. Driven by strongly seasonal rainfall, over each of the four
        years of observations, the hydrochemistry of the groundwater at each well
        repeats an annual cycle, which can be explained by two end-member processes.
        The first end-member process, which dominates during the winter high-flow
        season in mid- and upslope areas, is CO2 enhanced cation exchange reaction
        in the vadose zone in the more shallow conductive weathered bedrock. This
        process rapidly increases the cation concentrations of the infiltrated rainwater,
        which is responsible for the lowest cation concentration of groundwater. The
        second-end member process occurs in the deeper perched groundwater and either
        dominates year-round (at the downslope well) or becomes progressively dominant
        during low flow season at the two upper slope wells. This process is the equilibrium
        reaction with minerals such as calcite and clay minerals, but not with primary
        minerals, suggesting the critical role of the residence time of the water.
        Collectively, our measurements reveal that the hydrochemistry dynamics of
        the groundwater in the weathered bedrock zone is governed by two end-member
        processes whose dominance varies with critical zone structure, the relative
        importance of vadose versus groundwater zone processes, and thus with the
        seasonal variation of the chemistry of recharge and runoff. \nKim, Hyojin    Bishop,

        The European Union Water JPI (http://www.waterjpi.eu/) has funded the project
        PROGNOS (Predicting In-Lake Responses to Change Using Near Real Time Models  http://prognoswater.org/).  PROGNOS
        developed an integrated approach that couples high frequency (HF) lake monitoring
        data to dynamic lake water quality models to forecast short-term changes in
        lake water quality. Here we provide an archive that demonstrates model simulations
        that were run on Lake Erken as part of the PROGNOS project. Simulations were
        run using the GOTM (https://gotm.net/)and SELMA models that are coupled by
        the frame work for biogeochemical models (https://github.com/fabm-model).
        The lake model was calibrated using the program acpy (https://bolding-bruggeman.com/portfolio/acpy/)
        The measured data used for calibration in the format used by acpy are also
        included in this archive\n\nAll data were collected from Lake Erken the site
        of the Uppsala University Limnology field station (http://www.ieg.uu.se/erken-laboratory/).
        The simulation period is between 2004-2018, and we used a 5 year (1999-2003)
        model spin-up period prior to simulation and calibration.  Model forcing data
        are obtained from meteorological stations at the Erken laboratory, and from
        Erken&#39;s routine monitoring program.  To calibrate the model data sets
        of HF water temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence and dissolved oxygen are
        combined with laboratory measurement from the routine monitoring program.  Calibration

        provides key ecosystem services and is an important component in the hydrological
        cycle. Traditionally, the global distribution of vegetation is explained through
        climatic water availability. Locally, however, groundwater can aid growth
        by providing an extra water source (e.g. oases) or hinder growth by presenting
        a barrier to root expansion (e.g. swamps). In this study we analyse the global
        correlation between humidity (expressing climate driven water- and energy
        availability), groundwater and forest growth, approximated by the fraction
        of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and link this to climate
        and landscape position. The results show that at the continental scale, climate
        is the main driver of forest productivity; climates with higher water availability
        support higher energy absorption and consequentially more growth. Within all
        climate zones, however, landscape position substantially alters the growth
        patterns, both positively and negatively. The influence of the landscape on
        vegetation growth varies over climate, displaying the importance of analysing
        vegetation growth in a climate-landscape continuum. \nRoebroek, Caspar Tobias
